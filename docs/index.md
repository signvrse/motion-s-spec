# MOTION-S Signvrse Sign Language Dataset

**Version 1.0 | Release Date: TBD**

**Author:** Anthony Marugu

## Abstract

The Motion-S dataset represents a groundbreaking advancement in sign language technology, offering the first comprehensive multiview Kenyan Sign Language (KSL) corpus designed for next-generation AI applications. This dataset comprises 20,000+ professionally captured sign language sequences recorded using synchronized multi-camera arrays (6-8 cameras), delivering unprecedented 3D spatial coverage and reducing occlusion-related ambiguities common in single-view datasets.

## Key Innovations

1. **Full 360-degree multiview capture** enabling robust 3D pose estimation and avatar generation
2. **Integrated high-fidelity facial expression data** with 468 tracked landmarks critical for non-manual markers in KSL
3. **Professional-grade audiovisual quality** (1080p minimum, 30-60 fps) with synchronized speech and transcripts
4. **Enhanced BVHX format** incorporating both skeletal and facial animation data
5. **Comprehensive linguistic annotations** validated by the Deaf community
