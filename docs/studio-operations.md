# Studio Operations Guide

## Studio Operators Protocol

### Pre-Session Setup (30 minutes)

#### Equipment Power-On Sequence
1. **Power on central recording workstation**
2. **Launch recording software** (OBS Studio/similar)
3. **Verify all 6 camera feeds active** (3 per booth)
4. **Test teleprompter systems** (both booths)

#### Camera System Verification
- ‚úÖ Check camera sync indicators (green lights on all 6 cameras)
- ‚úÖ Verify recording paths: `/recordings/[DATE]/booth1/` and `/recordings/[DATE]/booth2/`
- ‚úÖ Test sample recording (5-second test on all cameras)
- ‚úÖ Confirm timestamp synchronization across cameras

#### Lighting Validation
- ‚úÖ Measure light levels with meter: 800+ lux at signer position
- ‚úÖ Check for shadows on hands/face areas
- ‚úÖ Verify color temperature consistency (5600K)

### Daily Calibration Checklist

#### Camera Calibration (Per Booth) - 10 minutes each
- ‚úÖ Place calibration board at signer position
- ‚úÖ Capture 10 frames from each camera angle
- ‚úÖ Run auto-calibration software
- ‚úÖ Verify reprojection error <1 pixel
- ‚úÖ Save calibration files: `[DATE]_booth[X]_calibration.json`

#### Audio/Visual Sync Test
- ‚úÖ Signer claps hands 3 times in each booth
- ‚úÖ Verify audio-visual sync within ¬±1 frame
- ‚úÖ Test teleprompter response time (<200ms)

### Recording Session Operations

#### Sign Recording Workflow (Per Sign)

**Pre-Recording (5 seconds):**
- Queue next sign word on teleprompter
- Verify signer ready position in all 3 camera views
- Check recording storage space (>1GB available)

**Recording Sequence:**

**START:** Press RECORD ALL button
- All 6 cameras begin recording simultaneously
- Teleprompter displays countdown: 3...2...1...
- Word appears with green border

**DURING:** Monitor quality indicators
- Watch for camera focus drift
- Check for occlusion warnings
- Monitor audio levels (if applicable)

**END:** Press STOP ALL when signer returns to neutral pose
- 2-second hold in neutral position required
- All cameras stop recording
- Files auto-saved with naming convention

#### Quality Control Checkpoints
- ‚úÖ All 3 cameras captured full sign sequence
- ‚úÖ No occlusion warnings triggered
- ‚úÖ Hand visibility >90% in at least 2 cameras
- ‚úÖ Facial expression clearly visible in front camera

### Equipment Troubleshooting Guide

#### Camera Issues

**Problem: Camera feed lost**
- Check USB/ethernet connection
- Restart camera software
- If persistent: Switch to backup camera

**Problem: Cameras out of sync**
- Stop all recording
- Restart sync software
- Re-run calibration if sync error >1 frame

#### Recording Issues

**Problem: File corruption**
- Check storage drive health
- Verify sufficient disk space
- Switch to backup recording drive

## Signers/Talent Protocol

### Pre-Recording Preparation (15 minutes)

#### Personal Setup

**Wardrobe Requirements:**
- Solid color clothing (avoid patterns, logos)
- Contrasting colors to skin tone
- No jewelry that interferes with hand tracking
- Hair secured away from face if long

**Position Setup:**
- Sit/stand at marked position in booth center
- Adjust stool height so arms move freely
- Test signing space - ensure no contact with walls/equipment
- Practice neutral "ready" position

### Sign Execution Guidelines

#### Optimal Signing Technique

**Spatial Requirements:**
- Keep all signing within 80cm x 80cm space in front of body
- Maintain consistent distance from cameras (2.5m)
- Face front camera for facial expressions
- Keep hands visible to side cameras

**Timing Protocol:**
1. **Ready Position:** Hands relaxed at sides or on lap
2. **Cue Recognition:** Wait for green border and countdown
3. **Sign Execution:** Clear, deliberate movements
4. **Hold Position:** Maintain final sign pose for 1 second
5. **Return to Neutral:** Smooth transition back to ready position
6. **Wait:** Remain still until next cue

**Performance Standards:**
- **Clarity:** Each sign must be distinct and well-formed
- **Consistency:** Repeat signs identically across takes
- **Speed:** Natural signing pace (not rushed or overly slow)
- **Expression:** Include appropriate facial expressions for context

### Communication Protocols

#### With Studio Operators

**Hand Signals (when audio communication unavailable):**
- üëç **Thumbs up:** Ready to continue
- ‚úã **Open palm raised:** Need a break
- üëâ **Pointing to camera:** Technical issue with specific camera
- üîÑ **Circular motion:** Request retake of last sign

#### Issue Reporting

**Technical Problems:**
- **If teleprompter malfunctions:** Raise both hands
- **If lighting changes:** Point to affected area
- **If equipment noise/distraction:** Cup ear and point to source

**Physical Comfort:**
- Request breaks every 30 minutes
- Report fatigue or strain immediately
- Communicate any discomfort with booth environment

### Performance Feedback System

#### Real-Time Feedback
- üü¢ **Green light on teleprompter:** Sign accepted
- üü° **Yellow light:** Acceptable but could improve
- üî¥ **Red light:** Retake required

#### Session Review
- Review selected recordings with operators
- Discuss areas for improvement
- Celebrate successful captures
- Plan adjustments for next session
